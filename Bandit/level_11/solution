Hi,

so in this level you just get a file which has gibberish data but if you look closely you may find some useful information, that is it somewhat looks like "the password is "flag"".


so we try to change every digit by any other digit , what could possibly the encoding , did they change the number of base digit it came to my mind?
no they didn't as the number of digits are same.

so we try to replace the digit by another digit, and we find that they are rotated by 13 characters and thats a famous encryption known as ROT13, and you can find the flag by either using the command or just downloading the package of rot13:

cat data.txt | tr 'a-zA-Z' 'n-za-mN-ZA-M'

tr command replaces the pattern1 with pattern2
