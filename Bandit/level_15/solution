Hi,

This level was mostly based on networking on a secure layer i.e SSL/TLS, i wondered around some commands like openssl and telnet then i came across s_client and things were preety easy.

i used the commands:


bandit15@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001

and then typed the password for current level and it gave me the flag.
