Hi,
so in this level you are given a repository "inhere" when you go inside that repository you find nothing, but wait a minute and type the command:
ls -lart

this command will give you all the files in long form (even the hiddden files)

that's when you find .hidden in this directory and when you concatenate that you find the flag.

ps: this means that all the files starting with a "." are hidden.
