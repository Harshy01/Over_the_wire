Hi,

so in this level it was preety clear that you need to find the flag which is in data.txt and is in base64 format.

base64 format just means that they are using 64 characters to define their words just like binary uses 2 characters(0 and 1) to define itself and as humans we communicate in a base26 encoding.

so to decode it we just have to use the simple command:

base64 -d data.txt

this will give you the flag.
