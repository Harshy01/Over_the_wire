Hi,
so in this file i just go on with doing what the readme file said, i just typed:

grep "==" data.txt

but as it was a binary data file grep replied with 
"Binary file data.txt matches" 

and that does not give me the flag, so what do i do?
i just find any other f*cking way to solve it, let's do this!

so, i first got a hexdump of the file and then used grep on that and found four matching options and as i can see the last matching pattern has the flag,
but the next challenge is to just print that specific flag.

now we have to use grep in such a way that we can get the fouth mathcing pattern and that also with the next two lines as you will see.

xxd data.txt | grep '=='  -A2 | tail -n3 | xxd -r

this command gives the output of flag with some ===

this is the closest i've come to the flag, if you can find more efficient way do ping me up on twitter: harshy01
