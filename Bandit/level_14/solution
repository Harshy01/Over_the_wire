Hi,

So here we are, in this level we have to send the password of current level to localhost at a port of 30000.

and there are some hints that the command used are ssh telnet nc openssl s_client nmap.

you can command: man "all the above commands"


after i found out that telnet is a command that can be used to communicate between two networks, then i used man command to find about telnet and found it's sypnosis.

telnet localhost 30000

this helped us get connected to localhost at port 30000 and then i typed the flag of current level to get the flag for next level.
